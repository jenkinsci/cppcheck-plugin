description.pattern=Cppcheck must be configured to generate XML reports for this plugin to function. \
<a href='http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/fileset.html'>Fileset 'includes'</a> \
setting that specifies the generated cppcheck XML report files, such as '**/cppcheck-result-*.xml'. \
Basedir of the fileset is relative to the module root unless you have configured \
your SCM with multiple modules, in which case it is relative to the \
workspace root.  Note that the module root is SCM-specific, and may \
not be the same as the workspace root. \
If no value is set, then the default '**/cppcheck-result.xml' is used. Be sure not to include any \
non-report files into this pattern.\
