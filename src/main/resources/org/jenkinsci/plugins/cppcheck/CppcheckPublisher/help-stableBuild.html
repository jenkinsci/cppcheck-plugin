<p style="margin-top: 0px;">By default, Cppcheck compares the report warnings 
and errors to that of the last build, which could be a build that was deemed 
unstable or that failed.  To compare the results of this build against the last 
"stable" build instead, check this option.</p>

<p>Note: When comparing against unstable builds, your builds could be marked as 
stable even when new errors or warnings have been introduced, because the delta 
between the last unstable build and current build could be zero.  If the 
unstable build introduced a new error but resolve an error, then the total 
error count will still be within the permitted threshold. Another build with 
the same results will be marked as stable, allowing the new error to go 
unnoticed.  Selecting this option will ensure all errors are accounted for.</p>
