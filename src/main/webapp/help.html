    <p>Jenkins understands the <a href="http://cppcheck.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Cppcheck</a> report XML format.
        When this option is configured, Jenkins can provide useful information about results in different views:
        historical result trend, analysis reports.</p>

    <p>You need to set up your build to run Cppcheck in order to use
        this feature - this Jenkins plug-in does not perform the actual analysis!
        This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
        stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
